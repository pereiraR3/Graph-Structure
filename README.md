# Structure With Graphs

Project started in 2024.

## Overview
The project is nothing more than a landing page that was requested by a research and extension group at the Federal University of Mato Grosso. The idea was basically to do something to show the focus of the research group, in addition to presenting its members and what they do.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used to develop the project are very simple.
